# Real-Time-Face-Presentation-Attack-Detection-with-Fairness-Considerations-for-Virtual-Environments

## Overview  
This project implements a real-time face presentation attack detection system using deep learning techniques. It integrates EfficientNetB3 for feature extraction and fairness-aware image enhancement to improve detection performance across different lighting conditions and skin tones.  

## Features  
- **Deep Learning-Based Spoof Detection**: Utilizes EfficientNetB3 for accurate feature extraction.  
- **Fairness-Aware Image Enhancement**: Ensures robust detection across diverse demographics.  
- **Real-Time Inference**: Implements OpenCV for real-time webcam-based face authentication.  
- **Optimized for Performance**: Efficient model architecture suitable for real-world deployment.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:
